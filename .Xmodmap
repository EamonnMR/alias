! Map capslock to escape
! From StackOverflow:
! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2176532/how-to-map-caps-lock-key-in-vim
! I removed the line that remaps esc to caps because I never use capslock
! and I want to keep the muscle memory for the escape key.

! For Mac:
! system preferences > keyboard > modifier keys 
! caps_lock to escape
! 
! For Linux:
! Leave this file in your home directory / call $ xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap 

remove Lock = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Escape
add Lock = Caps_Lock
